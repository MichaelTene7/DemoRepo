"Original Character, Do Not Steal" is an expression originally used on the art sharing site deviantART. 
While sometimes used literally to discourage fellow artists from stealing an artist's 
original character idea, it is more often used ironically to caption a picture of a character either 
obviously copied directly from an existing piece of pop culture or so sloppily rendered no one 
would want to steal it. The phrase is commonly used by Sonic fan artists.
On December 3rd, 2011, YouTuber Ukinojoe[5] uploaded a video titled "Blonic' which poked fun at users 
calling their artwork "original characters" by including "blonic", 
who was original, not a rip off of Sonic. The video description simply reads "
do not steal." As of March 2014, the video has gained over 1.3 million views
